### The AWS Global Cloud infrastructure is the backbone network of global data centres and other platforms that Amazon uses to deliver application workloads and AWS services.

### For cloud application and service delivery, customers provision and connect their end users and organizational environments to the following AWS global infrastructure components:


-	AWS Regions - AWS Regions are physical locations around the world where Amazon clusters data centres for application and service delivery in AWS Availability Zones. 

-	AWS Availability Zones - An Availability Zone (AZ) is a grouping of one or more discrete data centers that provide applications and services in an AWS region.

-	AWS Local Zones - AWS Local Zones are provisioned to run high-speed applications—such as media, entertainment, real-time gaming, live video streaming, and machine learning—that require single-digit millisecond latency to service users in specific geographic locations.

-	AWS Wavelength Zones - Wavelength zones provide 5G telecommunications connections inside AWS Regions.

### The AWS cloud spans 84 Availability Zones within 26 worldwide geographic regions. Announced plans include 21 more Availability Zones and seven more regions in Europe, Asia, and Australia.
There are currently e17 AWS Local Zones for ultralow latency applications.
There are 28 Wavelength Zones available for ultralow latency and 5G processing.
