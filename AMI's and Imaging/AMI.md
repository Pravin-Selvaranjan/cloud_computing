# AMI's and Imaging

### If we wish to make an image of a particular VM we can do this using AMI (Amazon Machine Image)

### This effectively captures the entirety of the VM and saves it in image that we can reload. This is more cost effective as stopping and starting an instance costs more than an AMI. 


- Once you have your initial working instance (by following the steps further up in this repo) you can create an AMI of your instance

- Select your instance and click on actions and then images and templates and finally create image

- Be sure to follow the naming convention when naming your AMI as you would with instances
